    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Some background for the software <a href="http://psoa.ruleml.org/metaviz/">PSOAMetaViz</a>
      can be found in the document <a href="http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/PSOA_RuleML_Bridges_Graph_and_Relational_Databases">PSOABridgesGraphRelDBs</a>.
      PSOAMetaViz visualizes the <a href="http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/PSOA_RuleML">PSOA RuleML</a> metamodel by a wireframe-like cube.
      The PSOA metamodel's three orthogonal dimensions of
      "Perspectivity", "Descriptor", and "OID"
      are mapped to three Cartesian axes.
      PSOAMetaViz in "3D" mode focuses the cube in the three switchable projections
      of Perspectivity, Descriptor, and OID.
      Alternatively, PSOAMetaViz can also be used in "2D" mode,
      where each focus becomes a corresponding set of rectangular slices.
      In both modes, the projections or slices constitute a scaffold
      for unit cubes or cells.
      In the ensuing 3D-projection or 2D-sliced systematics,
      each unit characterizes one kind of atom in PSOA RuleML.
    </p>
    <p>
      PSOAMetaViz creates a dynamic user experience as follows
      (cf. <a href="http://ruleml.org/talks/PSOAMetamodelGrailogWedding.pdf">PSOAMetamodelGrailogWedding.pdf</a>):
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Units point to characterizing 'cards', each containing
        <ul>
          <li>a general description of its atom kind according to a common template</li>
          <li>an (itself visualized) systematically changed atom as a running example</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Informed by 1., users can navigate from the current unit to any other unit,
        thus facilitating pairwise comparison of atoms
      </li>
      <li>
        Iterating 2., users can traverse metamodel paths, e.g. for exploring the PSOA RuleML design space and preparing atomic-fact interoperation by rules
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Visualization Principles</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to the 3D and 2D geometries,
      the following conventions (mnemonics in parentheses) are employed
      in the 3D mode of PSOAMetaViz:
    </p>
    <pre>
Perspectivity = color
  perspeneutral = red (cf. 'negative amount', i.e. independent)
  perspectival = green
  perspeneutral+perspectival = blue
Descriptor = texture
  tupled = horizontally striped (length-oriented, positional information)
  slotted = vertically striped
  tupled+slotted = digonally striped
OID = surrounding-line style
  oidless = dashed surrounding lines ("- -...- -" indicates no OID)
  oidful = solid surrounding lines
    </pre>
    <p>
      We refer to the boundary segments of the three dimensions in the three projections of the 3D cube as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
left/right
top/bottom
front/rear
    </pre>
    <p>
      Switching between the projections of the same cube results in the following focus transformations
      (the colors of the Perspectivity-focused entry screen help to keep track also of its transformations
      for the Descriptor focus and the OID focus):
    </p>
    <pre>
Perspectivity focus:
left = oidless
top = tupled
front = perspeneutral

Descriptor focus:
left = oidless
top = perspeneutral
front = tupled+slotted  

OID focus:
left = perspeneutral
top = tupled
front = oidful
    </pre>
    <h2>Software Use</h2>
    <p>
      The two menus in the upper-left corner can be used to
      independently choose the
      Perspectivity, Descriptor, or OID focus
      and the
      3D or 2D mode.
      With any focus and mode, each of the eighteen units can be selected to view its card
      (a new focus/mode choice resets any unit selection).
      The "?" button in the upper-left corner opens a new browser tab with
      this <a href="http://psoa.ruleml.org/metaviz/html/PSOAMetaVizExplained.html">PSOAMetaVizExplained.html</a> document.
    </p>
    <h2>Software Realization</h2>
    <p>
      A structured exposition of the JavaScript/JSON-based realization of PSOAMetaViz v1
      is given in the <a href="http://psoa.ruleml.org/metaviz/devNotes.txt">devNotes.txt</a> document.
      The GitHub source is in the <a href="https://github.com/RuleML/psoa-ruleml/tree/master/metaviz">metaviz</a> project.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
      Since it is lightweight and easy to use, PSOAMetaViz has become a practical GUI for
      gaining 'user meta-experience' about the fundamentals and ramifications of PSOA RuleML's metamodel.
