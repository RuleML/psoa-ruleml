OVERVIEW
PSOATransRun is an implementation of the Positional-Slotted, Object-Applicative
RuleML (PSOA RuleML) language. The PSOATransRun 1.0 release includes a composition 
of a translator PSOA2Prolog, from PSOA RuleML to a subset of the logic 
programming language ISO Prolog, with the well-known efficient XSB Prolog engine.
See http://psoa.ruleml.org for details of PSOA RuleML and PSOATransRun
and http://github.com/ZOUG/psoa2tptp for the repository.

REQUIREMENTS
Operating System: Windows or Linux
Prerequisites:
  Install Java version 6.0 or higher
  Install XSB Prolog 3.5 or higher (http://xsb.sourceforge.net) to a directory,
  the path of which we will call <xsb_dir>.

USAGE
Download http://psoa.ruleml.org/transrun/1.0/local/PSOATransRunLocal.jar to 
a directory, the path of which we will call <PSOATransRun_DIR>. 
Then follow these steps to run the program:

1. Open Command Line Prompt
Windows: see http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-vista/open-a-command-prompt-window
Linux: start the Linux Terminal

2. Change the working directory to <PSOATransRun_DIR> by executing
   cd <PSOATransRun_DIR>
In Windows, if <PSOATransRun_DIR> is on a different drive from the current
working directory, the command line option /d should be used:
   cd /d <PSOATransRun_DIR>

3. Execute the following command to enter a query loop for a <kb>:
   java -jar PSOATransRunLocal.jar -x <xsb_dir> -i <kb>
The -x <xsb_dir> part of the command can be omitted if the XSB_DIR environment
variable is set to <xsb_dir>.
<kb> is the path of the input knowledge base (KB) written in PSOA RuleML 
presentation syntax.

4. After the message "KB loaded" is shown, queries can be posed. One query at a time
is entered and every query must be in a single line. One answer at a time will be shown.
To get the next answer, press the semicolon key. To proceed to the next query, 
press the Enter key. To stop querying and exit, press Ctrl+C.
