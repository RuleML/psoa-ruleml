OVERVIEW
PSOATransRun is an implementation of the Positional-Slotted, Object-Applicative
RuleML (PSOA RuleML) language. The PSOATransRun 1.0 release includes a composition 
of a translator PSOA2Prolog, from PSOA RuleML to a subset of the logic 
programming language ISO Prolog, with the well-known efficient XSB Prolog engine.
See http://psoa.ruleml.org for details of PSOA RuleML and PSOATransRun
and http://github.com/ZOUG/psoa2tptp for the repository.

REQUIREMENTS
Operating System: Windows or Linux
Prerequisites: Java version 6.0 or higher, XSB Prolog 3.5 or higher (http://xsb.sourceforge.net/)

USAGE
Download http://psoa.ruleml.org/transrun/1.0/local/PSOATransRunLocal.jar to 
a directory, which we will call $PSOATransRun_DIR. Then follow these next steps 
to run the program:

1. Open Command Line Prompt
   Windows: see http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-vista/open-a-command-prompt-window
   Linux: start the Linux Terminal

2. Change the working directory to $PSOATransRun_DIR by executing
   cd $PSOATransRun_DIR
   In Windows, if $PSOATransRun_DIR is on a different drive from the current
   working directory, the command line option /d should be used:
   cd /d $PSOATransRun_DIR

3. Execute the following command:
   java -jar PSOATransRunLocal.jar -x <xsb_dir> -i <kb>

<kb> is the path of the input knowledge base (KB) written in the PSOA RuleML 
presentation syntax. <xsb_dir> is the path of the installation folder of XSB Prolog.

* The -x <xsb_dir> part of the command can be omitted if the XSB_DIR environment
variable is set to be the installation folder of XSB Prolog.

4. After the message "KB loaded" is shown, queries can be posed. One query at a time
is entered and every query must be in a single line. One answer at a time will be shown.
To get the next answer, press the semicolon key. To stop processing the current query 
and proceed to the next query, press the Enter key. To finish querying and exit, press 
Ctrl+Z and Enter (Windows) or Ctrl+D (Linux).
