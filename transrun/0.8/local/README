OVERVIEW
PSOATransRun is an implementation of the PSOA RuleML language. PSOATransRun 
composes a translator from PSOA to some target langauge t, and some runtime 
environment executing the language t. This release contains an instantiation 
using t=Prolog, composing a translator PSOA2Prolog and a runtime environment 
XSB Prolog. See http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php?title=PSOA_RuleML for more 
details of PSOA RuleML and PSOATransRun.

REQUIREMENTS
Operating System: Windows or Linux
Prerequisites: Java version 6.0 or higher, XSB Prolog 3.5 or higher

USAGE
Download http://psoa.ruleml.org/transrun/0.8/local/PSOATransRunLocal.jar to 
a directory, which we will call $PSOATransRun_DIR. Then follow the next steps 
to run the program:

1. Open Command Line Prompt
   On Windows, this can be done by:
   1) Click the key combination Windows+R, a "Run" box will be shown;
   2) Type cmd and click "Enter"
   
   On Linux, start the Linux Terminal

2. Change the working directory to $PSOATransRun_DIR by executing
   cd $PSOATransRun_DIR
   On Windows, if $PSOATransRun_DIR is on a different drive from the current
   working directory, the command line option /d should be used:
   cd /d $PSOATransRun_DIR

3. Execute the following command
   java -jar PSOATransRunLocal.jar -x <xsb_dir> -i <kb>

<kb> is the path of the input knowledge base (KB) written in the PSOA RuleML 
presentation syntax. <xsb_dir> is the path of the installation folder of XSB Prolog.

* The -x <xsb_dir> part of the command can be omitted if the XSB_DIR environment
variable is set to be the installation folder of XSB Prolog.

4. After the message "KB loaded" is shown, queries can be posed. One query is 
input at a time and every query must be in a single line. To finish querying
and exit, click Ctrl+Z and "Enter" (Windows) or Ctrl+D (Linux).
